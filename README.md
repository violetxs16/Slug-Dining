# Slug Dining
<b> Status: Complete </b>

1) <b>About: </b> 
This project involves implementing a multithreaded dining hall management system in C that uses POSIX threads for efficiency and synchronization mechanisms to control access to the dining hall. The system needs to handle students entering and leaving the dining hall while ensuring only a certain number of students can be inside at a time. Additionally, it must manage a cleaning service that requires the dining hall to be empty before it can begin cleaning. 

2) <b> Dependencies: </b>
pthread library for mutexes, condition variables and thread creation & manipulation
clang-format for formatting the code
stdlib library for memory allocation

3) <b> Build and Run: </b>
    Step 1: Reopen program in container
    Step 2: run make
    Step 4: run ./example1 or ./example2
4) <b> Languages used: </b>
C
Makefile
5) <b> Main program: </b> Dining.c 
6) <b> Test programs: </b> example1.c, example2.c
